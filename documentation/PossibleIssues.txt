### MIGRATION ISSUE

    If you are using new DB and migrate is not creating tables try:
        1. reset all migrations to the zeroth state
                python manage.py migrate --fake <appname> zero
        2. creat the tables
                python manage.py migrate <appname>



### INSTALL PYODBC ISSUE

    When running the application or the DB migrations you may get the following error:
    (0x0002): symbol not found in flat namespace '_SQLAllocHandle'

    A detail explanation of why that is happening is described here - https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/1124

    Environment where that can happen: Mac M1
    Reason: pyodbc 4.0.35 didn't include wheel files for ARM64 MacOSX, only regular Macs.

    The solution is NOT using pyodbc 4.0.35 or:
    pip install --no-binary :all: pyodbc
